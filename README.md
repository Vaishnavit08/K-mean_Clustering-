# K-means Clustering on Iris Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm on the Iris dataset. K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct groups based on their features. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains three classes of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Objectives

- To understand and implement the K-means clustering algorithm.
- To visualize the clustering of the Iris dataset.
- To evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithm.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling, and normalization of data.
- **K-means Clustering:** Implementation of the K-means algorithm to cluster the Iris dataset.
- **Visualization:** Plotting clusters and centroids for better understanding and interpretation.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the clustering using metrics like silhouette score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing the K-means algorithm and evaluation metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries installed (as specified in `requirements.txt`).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavit08/K-mean_Clustering-.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd K-mean_Clustering-
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   ```sh
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```

2. **Output:**
   - The script will perform K-means clustering on the Iris dataset and display the clusters using various visualizations.

## Data Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**

The dataset contains three classes of iris flowers:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

## Results

- **Cluster Visualization:** The clusters formed by the K-means algorithm are visualized using scatter plots.
- **Centroids:** The centroids of the clusters are marked and visualized.
- **Performance Metrics:** The silhouette score and other relevant metrics are calculated to evaluate the clustering performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different values of K to find the optimal number of clusters.
- **Advanced Clustering Algorithms:** Implement and compare with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use techniques like PCA for better visualization and understanding of high-dimensional data.
